# React Password Generator with Tailwind CSS

## Introduction

Welcome to my React Password Generator web app! This project demonstrates my learning and implementation of React hooks such as `useState`, `useCallback`, and `useEffect`, along with styling using Tailwind CSS. The application is designed to generate secure passwords with customizable options.

## Features

- **Password Length:** Choose a custom password length for enhanced security.
- **Character Sets:** Include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Easily copy the generated password with a single click.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling:** Employed Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and modern user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks:**
  - `useState`: Managed state variables for password length and character sets.
  - `useCallback`: Optimized performance with memoized callback functions.
  - `useEffect`: Handled side effects, such as updating the password on user input changes.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilized a utility-first CSS framework for efficient and customizable styling.

## Usage
